## Greetings from kevr

Throughout my life, I've worked heavily on backend systems. Base networking,
APIs, hardware drivers and discrete functionality are my passion; always
wanting to understand how computers speak with each other and improve how
that is done when I can.

I have been primarily using the Linux kernel and its friendly userspace
utilities for daily-driver development for the past 15 years or so.

I work on a few FOSS projects in my free time:

- [aurweb](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/aurweb) - Arch User Repository
- [taskpp](https://gitlab.com/kevr2d2/taskpp) - Task manager written in C++
- [sprunge](https://github.com/kevr/sprunge) - CLI sprunge.us pastebin tool
- [hastebin](https://github.com/kevr/hastebin) - CLI hastebin.com pastebin tool
- [system76-kbd-led](https://github.com/kevr/system76-kbd-led) - Userspace LED controller for System76 laptops
- [trackbranch](https://github.com/kevr/trackbranch) - Profiling utility for git branch management
- [kevr.0cost.org](https://github.com/kevr/kevr.0cost.org) - Source code for https://kevr.0cost.org, my portfolio
- [flyspray2gitlab](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/kevr/flyspray2gitlab) - Migrate Flyspray tasks to Gitlab issues (customized for bugs.archlinux.org)

In addition to my FOSS software, I've worked in the virtualization industry
for much of my career, for which I've written hardware drivers (RFID,
fingerprint), networked APIs and Bluetooth sensory applications.

In my free time, I like to work on my FOSS projects and microelectronics
(for which I have recently began learning about).
