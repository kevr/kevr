## Greetings from kevr

Throughout my life, I've worked heavily on web-facing APIs, frontends
and distributed systems. Today, I continue to create utilities and increase my
knowledge while improving project management and testing methodologies.

I work on a few FOSS projects in my free time:

- [droid0](https://github.com/kevr/droid0) - Pluggable IRC chatbot written in C++17
- [aurweb](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/aurweb) - Arch User Repository
- [sprunge](https://github.com/kevr/sprunge) - CLI sprunge.us pastebin tool
- [hastebin](https://github.com/kevr/hastebin) - CLI hastebin.com pastebin tool
- [system76-kbd-led](https://github.com/kevr/system76-kbd-led) - Userspace LED controller for System76 laptops
- [kevr.0cost.org](https://github.com/kevr/kevr.0cost.org) - Source code for https://kevr.0cost.org, my portfolio
- [flyspray2gitlab](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/kevr/flyspray2gitlab) - Migrate Flyspray tasks to Gitlab issues (for legacy bugs.archlinux.org migration)
- [StayInYourBiome](https://github.com/kevr/StayInYourBiome) - A Valheim mod which stops high-level creatures from spawning in lower-level areas due to boss kills
- [GetYourOwnPortal](https://github.com/kevr/GetYourOwnPortal) - A Valheim mod which gives ownership of built portals to its builder
    - Removes portal conflicts in multiplayer context

In addition to my FOSS software, I've worked in the virtualization industry
for much of my career, for which I've written hardware drivers (RFID,
fingerprint), networked APIs and Bluetooth sensory applications.

In my free time, I like to work on my FOSS projects and microelectronics
(for which I have recently began learning about).
